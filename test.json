        "text": "My thesis is the world is carefully set up to keep most people working until they're old. While in comparison, the 0.01% have most of the wealth and income to do what they like and live it up. And that 0.01% keep 1% relatively well compensated to make sure everyone else stays in line.\n\nTake the average price of a house in Dublin: about \u20ac405,000 by 2021 figures.\n\nSalaries: I've set out below what an individual can roughly expect to take home per month based on salary.\n\n10k: \u20ac833 pm\n\n30k: \u20ac2,130 pm\n\n50k: \u20ac3,102 pm\n\n70k: \u20ac3,960 pm\n\n90k: \u20ac4,760 pm\n\n110k: \u20ac5,560 pm\n\n130k: \u20ac6,360 pm\n\n150k: \u20ac7,160 pm\n\nSo beyond a \u20ac50k salary, every extra \u20ac20k you earn is worth \u20ac800 a month to you. Which doesn't feel like a great deal in some ways. My point being a relatively small number of people earn say 110k in Ireland and yet they're still on the hamster wheel too. Because if you make that money, I'd argue your job will increasingly deny you the time required to live a happy and stress free life for yourself and those close to you who either require or deserve your time instead.\n\nFor example, if your salary is 110k a year which most people would agree is doing well... to buy that average house in Dublin, that's \u20ac405,000/\u20ac5560 pm = 72.84 months/12 = 6.07 years.\n\nSo if you never spent a penny, to eat, or travel, to live or do anything... if you didn't have a glass of water, it'd still take you 6 years on \u20ac110k to buy an average Dublin house. On that \u20ac110k salary, imagine now realistically you save 20% (\u20ac1,112) a month which again could be a feat in itself. Congratulations, it'll now only take you 30 years to save up that cash. \n\nMy point being pretty much everyone has to either rent for most their life or give 30 years of their life over to banks for a mortgage to be in a position to buy a house. It just all seems crazy.\n\nAnd that's the same whether you're on \u20ac50k or \u20ac150k. So what chance does anyone on less have?!\n\nI genuinely believe there's no political will (or political ability) to alleviate this. Most political figures only have eyes on legacy, of having sat at or near the top with the prospect of moving up in industry as the goal. The EU, UN, lobbying, public speaking etc. The housing problem is a systemic issue and you simply don't rise in politics by being someone who addresses root issues. Because the system as it exists rewards those who maintain and encourage it.\n\nAnd so the hamster wheel spins on, it just needs to be kept well oiled. \n\nIf you think your best chance of getting off the hamster wheel is to run faster and earn that \u20ac110k+, I'm not buying it.\n\n**Edit 2pm**: To those suggesting I've never heard of mortgages, the point I'm making is it shouldn't be the case that a person who works all their life has the choice of either being heavily indebted to (a) a landlord or (b) a bank, simply for a decent place to sleep at night. And yet we are and some people are more comfortable about questioning that reality than others.\n\nSecondly, I'm not saying people should necessarily be in a position to, or expect to be in a position where they can outright buy a home in cash.  I'm making the point that taking on a significant mortgage today will at best get you an average priced house. Which is an unfortunate reality. As in \"You'll take what you get and you'll be happy\". Just wait for interest rates to start creeping up in the fight \nwith inflation. In 10 years time will we all be stuck for half a million euro fighting banks and lawyers over a 2.5 bed on the edge of Dublin? Will we be saying the audacity of you all to think your three children could each have a bedroom."

They have printed $9 trillion alone since covid began.\n\nQuantitative easing is basically where the central banks flood money into the market by buying bonds of governments/banks etc., all this money eventually flows into the equity & property markets which is why we are seeing the huge increases in prices over the last few years. The banks like to hide inflation by using indexes like the CPI that don\u2019t take things like property increases into account. The true inflation over the last few years is significantly higher than the 5 to 10% figures that are being thrown around over the last few months. Obviously just creating $9 trillion out of thin air is going to have knock on effects and devalue everyones cash, the only thing it doesn\u2019t devalue is assets because there\u2019s a finite supply of them. These policies basically just increase wealth inequality.\n\nI see a lot of people here like to go on about \u2018supply\u2019 this and \u2018government\u2019 that but at the end of the day the housing crisis is a global issue and all these arguments about how incompetent the Irish government are is complete bullshit, there\u2019s feck all they can do about it. (I'm not saying they aren't incompetent, just that its kind of irrelevant). Yes, they can maybe alleviate/amplify the problem slightly by trying to regulate the market, but I don\u2019t think increasing supply is going to change prices because demand isn\u2019t really domestic its actually global, increasing supply isn\u2019t going to make a dent in the demand.\n\nPeople might argue to create regulations to ensure the demand is only domestic but this will just worsen the problem over time because:\n\n* Foreign investors can't invest anymore so supply will reduce.\n* Domestic investors will see foreign property markets (who don't have regulations in place) achieve higher growth and returns, so will increase foreign investment and hence reduce domestic investment.\n\nJust posting this because out of all the posts on here about housing I\u2019ve never heard one person mention quantitative easing being the crux of the issue"

Before I go on it has to be understood that after 2008 they never fixed anything, they literally threw money at the problem buying mass amounts of junk bonds and holding them on both FED and EU central bank balance sheets to effectively wallpaper over the problem.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v9iutpwyzqd71.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=594c5e5f0204412cb40fe7db616ab3c57069e12b\n\nFig 1: Irish house prices from 2012-2019, I could not get a good long term chart but you can imagine the run up to 2008 than crash\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/byhohou00rd71.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=237302756e0697a63c4e1fd6432b48dcf288b20d\n\nFig 2: Rent vs. income 2008-2019 to illustrate increasing rental prices in line with house prices\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k164dco30rd71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa1e0b3b48e51ddb67a5d1df2db15043e708b807\n\nFig 3: Long term US house price chart\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oxxldgx50rd71.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=95289f117c740d819b80bb1a6dd5156c5da2080b\n\nFig 4: Long term UK house price chart\n\nFor the ease of formatting, I will discuss figure 1-4 here. Look at the similarity of the house price charts between Ireland, the UK and the US, this illustrates that this is not just an Irish problem caused by local/ national government issues. It\u2019s a long term global and economic trend, obviously there are steps the government could have taken to lessen it but not even our government can\u2019t stem the tide of a global trend; I will explain the driver of this trend later. I also included a chart of rental costs vs. income as it will interest many here to show that it is closely linked to this over arching trend in property prices. I will go into the reasons driving this later but for now we will call it inflation. I will let you do your own digging on the subject of inflation, but don\u2019t trust the current official figures. The way we measure inflation was modified to give more amenable numbers for central banks in both the 1980 and again in the 1990. If you look for that data in shadow stats ([http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate\\_data/inflation-charts](http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts) , link to make your life easy), the real inflation is double digit or high single digit respectively if you work by the older calculations. Recent changes to the inflation calculation have decoupled if from the M1 and M2 money supply, which is utterly ridiculous given inflation is supposed to measure money supply, this is a barefaced attempt to mask the effects of QE money printing but I digress. It is important to note now the dip in 2014 as this becomes important later.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g6z4pzm80rd71.png?width=413&format=png&auto=webp&s=f803026f3f02a34c7ddcc857ac92998bf1e96ead\n\nFigure 5: FED bond buying program, including toxic assets from financial institutions, government bonds etc.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2txnlna0rd71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=a525e00e64252c5dc244c620ceaeb81707722da2\n\nFigure 6: EU Central bank bond buying program, including toxic assets from financial institutions, government bonds etc.\n\nAs with above for ease of formatting I will discuss figure 5-6 together. These charts show the levels of buying of toxic debt/ assets from banks and government bonds by the FED and central banks to stabilise the global economy and banking system. I\u2019m sure that I don\u2019t have to point out to you that these charts closely track the cost of housing charts. The initial spike in bond buying was to stabilise the market after 2008, then we see that 2014 dip and a rise again. This dip I will have to go into further detail on, after the 2008 crash there was QE to stabilize the market but you can\u2019t do this forever because it has the effect of pulling assets from the market and flooding it with liquidity. While it served a purpose of keeping interest rates artificially low to encourage borrowing and spending there came a point where they had to try and stop it, this is done using QT (quantitative tightening) which in layman\u2019s terms is pulling money out of the market or reducing liquidity. This almost crashed the economy, and you can see this in the housing market dip, so they re-implemented QE and we have been in it ever since. Then covid hit and the put a turbo and super charger on the QE program. As anyone who follows economics will know QE=central bank money printing=inflation, this has driven a rapid and artificial rise in asset prices over the last 10 years. To take an extreme example look at the stock market rise in the US when the government was pouring money out like a leaky dam to stop the economy from crashing due to covid, the wild printing of money drove up asset prices because when that much money is being printed cash is worthless and assets valuable. This can be seen as a more long term trend in the aggressive rise of the NYSE inflation index from 2010 onwards, this is linked to the driving up of house prices in that same time frame. \n\nThis is my reasoning on why the rise in living and housing costs has become so unfordable, inflation hits those that can least afford it first. Ever since the 2008 crash central banks have been buying bonds to stave off a crash without fixing the underlying problem, as is clearly illustrated in the 2014 near crash when they tried to turn off the tap. Recently the EU central bank said they would have an \u2018unlimited bond buying program\u2019 to stop a covid related crash, what happens when they turn off the tap? We are already seeing the effects of inflation hitting working people, they are likely to increase interest rates due to this which will bring prices back down. But it will take the full house of cards down with it, and god knows the devastating effects of that.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j08fhv3d0rd71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cacba0013e19b1f8694d6b9af7b4832adbbb955\n\nFig 7: NYSE inflation index\n\nEdit 1: I figured I\u2019d deal with this one up here as opposed to replying to each comment individually. But I\u2019m sure that there is an element of supply and demand driving Ireland\u2019s current prices. That being said given the correlation between the upswing in prices in different countries over the same time frame I would question the likelihood that they are all experiencing supply shortage the same way at the same time. The level of bond buying by central banks seems to correlate pretty well across all regions, not to say correlation=causation but it seems unlikely that a number of countries would have a supply and demand issue at the same time to drive the prices up over a similar time frame. I would also point out that they are not the only asset class reaching unreasonable price levels over the same time frame."

We love the house but it is at the top of our budget and I feel we would be daft not to attempt to get a better deal and just ignore everything that going on in the economy.\n\nIt is a family of 4 adults selling their parents house so a reduction of \u20ac30k would be \u20ac7.5k each but would make things a lot easier for us. The house is agreed at \u20ac490,000 and we would like to ask for \u20ac450,000 but we\u2019d settle for \u20ac460,000.\n\nFYI this house is in a nice town in the west of Ireland but \n\nWhat do you think of this suggested wording:\n\nWe are keen to proceed with the purchase and have progressed with the bank approvals and necessary legal steps as we had hoped that the impact of COVID19 would be short term. However, the impact to the economy and house prices (including our current house) has been significant so we would like the vendor to recognise the unprecedented times we are currently in. We certainly can\u2019t purchase a house that would see us immediately enter into negative equity. Although the recent ESRI report cited a 12% drop in house values, we would be comfortable paying up to \u20ac450,000  which is approximately an 8% adjustment. \nIf this is something the vendors can agree to, we can quickly close out this purchase in 2-3 weeks according to our solicitor.\n\nIs there anything else I should say? I feel quite sick with the risk of buying at top of market when you consider our recent history in the country. Equally, there were other bidders interested in the house and I know there\u2019s a risk that we lose out to them. Our solicitor thinks everyone\u2019s situation has changed since early March so we shouldn\u2019t be concerned about that.\n\nThank you for helping"

        "text": "Hello Redditors. I have an issue and Im not sure what to do. For the last 6 months of last year I was suffering with unusually high blood pressure and headaches. Went to GP a few times and ended up on blood pressure tablets. I had been back to the GP's about 7 times over this issue for 24 BP monitors and even ended up in accident and emergency back in October die to being a stroke risk over how high my BP was. Then at the start of October I was heading into Dublin on the dart and ended up fainting. Couldn't get a doctor in Dublin right after because I wasn't a registered patient and I didnt go to the hospital because I wasn't prepared to spend 12 hours sitting around waiting to be told that there was nothing wrong with me. Went to the GP the following weekend and as I have health insurance from work he said I would be better off getting a complete medical assessment in the Bons Secuors in Cork. \n\nThe GP initially told me this would cost whatever my excess is.\n\nThe hospital rang me and told me that Id have to pay 330 on the day and then Id get a bill for another 220 at a later date.\n\nI went in to the assessment unit and paid the 330 so they could start doing there tests. They did loads of tests on the Thursday and then I did an MRI on the Friday morning. I was then told that I had to wear different monitors for the duration of my stay. My assigned consultant then said it would be best if I stuck around to see a neurologist just to rule out that there was nothing messed up in my brain that caused the faint. It was two days later that he turned up so I was literally sat there for 48 hours waiting for him to turn up. \n\nSkip forward to this week and I have recieved a letter from my health insurance advising that me staying in the hospital for so long was unnecessary so they aren't covering any of it and they have sent me an invoice from the hospital for 4 grand.\n\nI've no idea what to do. Ive to ring them this morning to see what the story is but everything I did was under medical advise whiles there. I had zero say in tests done and how long I was kept there. I even brought one change of cloths with me because I was told I would most likely have to stay for a night. I asked a nurse on Saturday evening if I could leave to go buy some cloths so I could be wearing something clean and I was told that I wasn't permitted to leave the building by my insurance company so I was actually being held there until I was given the all clear.\n\nI've no idea what to do. 4 grand is more money than I've ever had to my name in my life. In fact, because of the cost of living Im actually about 2k worse off than I was this time last year. \n\nHas anyone here had a similar experience or would anyone know what my next best steps are? Any advice greatly appreciated.\n\nTl;dr I was sent to the hospital for a medical assessment under my insurance by my GP,  the hospital kept me there for days doing tests and waiting on a specialist to come to work, insurance said me staying was unnecessary, now Im stuck with an astronomical medical bill."

Naturally this sparked a conversation about other times the office ventured out as a group and someone mentioned The Incident (from long before my time in the office). \n\nBasically there was a dinner as a farewell a few years ago and the bill came to about \u20ac500 for the group of ten. Naturally the guest of honour didn\u2019t pay and everyone added a few euro for their meal and proceeded to divvy up the rest of the bill\u2026except one woman who put in the money for the guest of honour but who then paid \u20ac25 for herself because she only had a main and a coke and she doesn\u2019t drink at all so she didn\u2019t see why she should have to pay double for the others to have wine and desserts with their dinner. The \u20ac25 she paid covered her dinner and drink and left money over for a tip, but she was absolutely slated for not putting in the full \u20ac50. She has forever been labelled as *tight* and that\u2019s apparently worse than murder! \n\nHalf of the office feel this was a serious faux pas and the height of bad manners but the other half think she was right to pay for what she had and not add in the extra \u20ac25. \n\nWe have been informed that on the night in question the bill will be divided evenly and if you choose to not have wine/dessert/extras, that\u2019s your problem. I ended up making my excuses to cancel because office politics are tricky enough without adding social affairs and I wouldn\u2019t be able to drink anyway unless I wanted to spend an extra \u20ac60 on a taxi or stay in a hotel so paying for everyone else\u2019s drinks leaves me feeling deflated and I\u2019d probably be pretty annoyed by forking over double what my meal cost!\n\nSo Reddit, tell me what you think? Am I being stingy or would you feel the same?\n\nEditing to add: There is also a small in office do for the entire building, paid for by the bosses, where the leaver will have catered sandwiches/cakes/nibbles and will be presented with flowers and a gift. The meal/drinks out is like an informal thing that\u2019s just for our office because we worked closely with the person leaving. Attendance is optional (but not really because office politics dictates if we aren\u2019t there we are seen as snubbing the guest of honour). I have made my excuses and bowed out but I will probably put \u20ac20 towards a round in order to not be the office tightarse!"

I also got a response from John Lahart which I have shared below for anyone interested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Do you think that long term leases are an effective use of public money and a sustainable solution to the lack of social housing?\u00a0\n\n**(JL) I disagree with them completely but this additional 100 units are clearly a necessary evil particularly given the unforeseen challenges facing government with regard to the need for additional social homes \u2013 allied to the failure of some councils, including my own to complete social housing schemes \u2013 SDCC completed one social home last year.**\n\n2) Do you think it is fair on the ordinary hard working people in this country that they must compete with the state when trying to buy or rent a home?\u00a0\n\n**(JL) Absolutely not and I could say a lot more about this too \u2013 I completely disagree with the state, through Councils, either leasing or buying up homes that were initially intended for first-time buyers, for example.**\n\n3) What cost benefit analysis has been done on this plan?\u00a0\n\n**(JL) Probably none \u2013 there is a housing crisis and stock has to be procured.\u00a0 By the end of this year supply will be increasing.**\n\n4) Has an alternative plan been drawn up, including the direct building of social housing on state land and if so how many units could be provided for the same money?\u00a0\n\n**(JL) There is a mixtures of responses \u2013 including the building of homes on state land \u2013 forty were due to be completed this year in Firhouse at Delany\u2019s Pub, but the contractor got into difficulties, and the contract has been retendered.\u00a0 There is a scheme to be completed in Tallaght and another 200 or social homes to be built at Killinarden which has been approved.**\n\n5) Has the state considered that it would be a better use of public funds to purchase the units directly instead of allowing an investment fund to purchase them so they can be leased back to the state, therefore at least having an asset that the state would own?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**(JL) I completely agree with you and I will follow up on this one \u2013 there was an issue with EU State Aid rules before and the usual on-off balance sheet argument.\u00a0 The question is I guess, among many questions, as to who would manage them?**"

        "title": "Ukrainian perspective on housing crisis",
        "text": "Ukrainian refugees here. It really feels in here that economy is booming unironically. But as for now I want to address housing crisis:\n\nHalf a million for a house is really badass. In post soviet countries families of 4 live in two-bedroom flats. Couples of 2 live in a one-bedroom flat and 1 lonely man enjoys a studio. 50k-100k for a good 2-bedroom flat in the center of Kyiv (capital city). Rent is like 300eur per month + 50-100eur for water+electricity. And because of war house prices has fallen for around 15-20%.\n\nFor that I am really shocked is that people just live in big houses in Dublin centre. It really has great charm and it's nice to have a small garden but isn't that a suburban living advantages? Like in USA or more functional eu cities, where city is just skyscrapers with lots of accommodations and business centres, while industrial buildings have their own districts and mid-class enjoys housing in a sleepy suburbans? My gf family has a house in 20km from Kyiv and it takes 30min-1hour to get to job by car and it's approx 300-500euro taxes for gas, water and electricity. I lived with mom, granny and my gf in 2 bedroom flat in Kyiv. It might not sound very prestigious, but with my salary of 400eur per month I had to pay only 50-70eur taxes for all of my family.\n\nMy point is that a big amount of houses prevents cities from developing as centers of businesses for the people. If there were more flats and high buildings that use vertical space in the Dublin city itself it would lower the housing prices significantly. But what I do understand that I can't offer any good fast solution, except for radical ones - to take from the rich, confiscate houses and relocate people, destroy historical buildings and city planning (which was actually done in the Soviet Union, but for what cost...?)\n\nThe way we used to progress in Kyiv before Russian invasion was like this - government created good conditions for building companies to build whatever they want. At first it was shopping malls everywhere (I had four really big ones in 10 minutes walk from home). Then they began building houses, taking investments from government, city hall and regular people (like you pay money now and get a house as soon as they build it). It involved corruption, tax frauds and shady connections but it was not complete freedom. People protested if companies delayed buildings terms, tried to destroy some cool historical stuff or just didn't built parks around for people to have a bit of nature. Yes, government took more pro-capitalist approach in this sphere but when something really bad happened (I do not mean destroying historical buildings or churches, etc - it all was sacrificed for progress) they always took a people's side. When company my family invested in 7 years ago went bankrupt in 2020 we protested near city hall for several days and it resulted to take over of that company by the government. By now most of their buildings has been already finished (including our apartment) even though the company didn't got big profits.\n\nI don't want to offend anyone - Dublin is amazing. It really feels like a promised land for me and I want to become a part of Irish society (that's why I decided to start this discussion). But there are only harsh solutions for fixing housing problem in 5-10 years. And that means even more transformations for the state, which not all would like.\n\nIreland is really having an economic boom. You have megacorporations, workforce from EU (including myself), decent standards of living and the connections with whole world - from USA and UK to Asia and Middle East! That is something that was just a dream for Ukraine. Yes, there are high tax rates, housing crisis and God knows what ahead, but you can go anywhere in a world, knowing that you're among equals or even superior. \n\nIf you won't hate me for this post I might address other issues that interest me, because I want to get a deeper knowledge of you (yes, personally you!) via discussion."

This is going to bring us back to short term solutions, to having big housing estates at the edges, or even beyond, our cities and towns. We know that will take us down planning, community, infrastructure and environmental culs-de-sac.\"\n\nHe's making valid points. Whether it's reducing standards on energy ratings, or allowing building to take place out on the very edges of towns, away from infrastructure, it all comes back to bite us in the arse. We pay for it one way or another, and just because we've a housing disaster, doesn't mean we should shoot first, pay double later."

        "text": "Hear me out: I know the normal the automatic reaction is \"We can't do that!\" Well let's just question that assumption for two minutes. What would it take to host a World Cup, and what do we have?\n\n* The first objection you always heard was **we're too small to host a World Cup**. Well that objection is scriosta now. We are 7.23 times bigger than the current host. https://old.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/z6e0ab/qatar_wc_stadiums_locations_mapped_out_around/\n\n* Our small size is an advantage, not a detriment. The players and fans will have quicker travel times. A big event concentrated in a small space will create a deadly atmosphere; the whole country will be World Cup mad for months. Here is the [PDF](https://web.archive.org/web/20101214044951/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/01/33/74/52/b5ruse.pdf) of FIFA's report on Russia's 2018 bid; Ctrl+F 'travel' or 'travel time', and you'll see that compact size is considered a big advantage.\n\n* So if it's not size that stops us, then what is it? Must be money or infrastructure. Well no host ever had the infrastructure when they made the bid; you make the bid and then build&upgrade infrastructure. \n\n* **Money**: according to [this](https://www.newarab.com/news/no-qatar-has-not-spent-220-billion-world-cup-stadiums), **Russia spent $11.6 billion to host the World Cup, Brazil spent $15 billion**. (Qatar's spend is disputed and I'll leave it out.)\n\n* **What does it actually take to host a World Cup, in terms of stadia?** Germany [had](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup#Venues) 12 stadia of capacity 41-72k. South Africa [had](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup#Venues) ten with capacity 40,911 to 84,490. Brazil [had 12 venues (seven new and five renovated)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup#Venues), the smallest 39,631 and the biggest 74,738. Russia [hosted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup#Venues) with 12 stadia and \"Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament\". Qatar [is hosting with just 8 stadia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#Venues) the smallest 44,325 and the largest 88,966\n\n* **[We already have five stadia that are World Cup sized!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stadiums_in_Ireland_by_capacity)**. Croker holds 82,300, and that's MORE than attended the [2014 final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup_Final) and [2018 final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_Final). Five isn't enough, but most hosts don't start with enough when they make the bid. We just saw that South Africa built seven and renovated five, Russia built nine.\n\n* Yes, Croker and the others have hosted foreign sports for 15 years now.\n\n* Another point I want to pull out from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#Venues is \"the upper tiers of the stadiums will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure\". **This answers the objection that \"arrah we don't want to build all those stadia that we'd never use afterwards\"**\n\n* Hosting a World Cup will be an impetus for building rail and other infrastructure. This infrastructure would serve us into the future. Good infrastructure is a long-term economic stimulus, in addition to the short-term cash injection.\n\n* **Economic impacts of hosting a World Cup**: [this article](https://www.supplier.io/blog/economic-impact-of-hosting-a-world-cup) quotes a 2010 FIFA presentation that the 2006 World Cup brought \u20ac2.86 billion to Germany, generated \u20ac104 million in tax, created 50k jobs for eight months, and boosted GDP 0.3%; it goes on to discuss a consulting firms analysis of the 2026 World Cup, including \u20ac1 billion in earnings. [This mentions](https://angeloueconomics.com/keep-up-with-ae/understanding-the-economic-impact-of-hosting-the-fifa-world-cup/) that Qatar was expected to rake in $20 billion from hosting, later revised down to $17 billion.\n\n* It raises our [soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power)\n\n**TL;DR**: We are a nice, compact country. We have half the stadia and building the other half is the norm. We are a rich country and it only costs $10-15 billion. That's gross outlay, net figures would be positive with a bit of luck. It'd give us infrastructure. We'd also qualify for the feckin thing for a change.\n\nThanks for listening, I trust you'll vote for me."

Although it hasn't been lived in for a few years, with some cleaning, DIY jobs etc it would be possible to move in soon. However, long term it requires more TLC (new windows, maybe insulation etc). We were hoping to perhaps add an extension of 40m2 to make an open plan living room/kitchen and a bedroom. At present it has two box rooms, a kitchenette and a toilet. Outside, the garden needs some work (which we could do ourselves) but the house needs a septic tank. (Prev tank on neighbors property!) Just wondering if anyone knows roughly how much this sorta job would cost. We seem to be getting mixed msgs, some saying \u20ac1350m2 exc. VAT for extension while others are saying with building and septic tank it could be \u20ac200k!!!
