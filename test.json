Did not know Ben and Jerry's was so expensive so will knock that on the head.\n\nIn same Centra a chicken and salad roll and coffee costs 8.50 euro. 5.50 for roll, 3 euro for coffee.\n\nA pint of Moretti in Dublin costs 7.50 euro\n\nA basic jumper or jacket in most shops costs north of 100 euro now\n\nMost pair of shoes/runners cost well north of 100 euro now\n\nEverything costs a subscription now, netflix, amazon etc\n\nNew and used car prices are up over 50% since covid\n\nA Cinema Ticket is 14.50 at Odeon and and getting popcorn and coke is another 11 or 12 i think so over 25 to go Cinema for one person\n\nIn a bar in meath recently a tiny and i mean tiny bottle of coke was about 3.50 euro\n\nCost of hotel rooms are obviously insane.\n\nTo rent a room in Dublin costs 800 euro a month maybe more\n\nElectricity and fuel are up a crazy amount\n\nTo be honest apart from rent and electricity i dont care much about these price rises because a lot of these items are discretionary and I can just buy rice and chicken and make very cheap meals. I am also  am happy to wear cheap clothing from pennys or pull and bear and wear it for a long time. I am also happy to drive a very old car. You also don't miss Netflix after you cancel it. My laptop is 7 years old and working really great and my smartphone is a cheap android. For alcohol 70cl vodka and big bottle of coke from tesco can last a long time if you just wanting something to sip on a weekend evening, and is relatively great value considering how much a cocktail costs out.\n\nMy point isn't so much that I'm angry at the price rises then I am sort of bemused that I am being completely priced out of living a consumerist life. Like even if I wanted to I  couldn't on a regular wage as I have to save up to eventually buy/build a house (hopefully). In a way I am sort of relieved as this is going to force me to live a more sustainable frugal life which i think in the long run is healthier. So yeah Capitalist Ireland I bid you Adieu I'm off to knit myself a sweater, watch the free movie on rte and eat some rice chicken and beans.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like they are entering a post-consumer period of their lives? And by post consumer I don't mean not buying anything as you still have to buy things but just not buying things they way you used to\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I'm getting lots of sensible comments on this and also some silly comments but one comment basically summed up in two lines what I tried to say in an essay. \n\n(Comment from composmentus) \"The promise of capitalism is that YOU, yes you, can enjoy the fruits of capitalism if you work hard. If you can no longer enjoy those abundant fruits then capitalism has broken down\". "

        "text": "Guys, I\u2019m a 25Y girl based in Dublin Ireland. As I get older the thought of remaining here makes me feel more and more sad and depressed. I\u2019ve come to the clear realisation that I must move, even if it\u2019s just to the U.K. but remaining here isn\u2019t really an option anymore unless I wanna continue to suffer terrible living conditions. \n\nIt truly saddens me that I\u2019ve gone to university (a good one btw), busted my bottom to get a good job and I\u2019m still living like shit. I live at home because it\u2019s the most affordable for me, which is really sad as I worked to have a decent job (in marketing). I\u2019ve considered moving out but the instability in the non-family rental market looks terrifying in terms of physical and financial stability. The prices are extortionate for low quality and it would pull me further away from my goal of owning a home. So, at the moment I endure sharing a bedroom with my sister as a 25 Y old adult. We both pay rent to my mam, which is more stable than paying to a landlord but the sadness of it all is starting to creep up on me.  Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m 25, finished masters about 6 months ago (paid myself). I pay about 500 monthly in household contributions which is great, but again it\u2019s for a really poor quality of living as it\u2019s now a lot of adults living in one house due to the rental conditions out there. I work a lot so it means that in the few opportunities I do have to rest, the quality of rest is quite shit since it\u2019s a busy household. Maybe there\u2019s music, chatting across the house, normal daily household noise. \n\nIt\u2019s funny, I\u2019d mentioned about home ownership before. The topic of home ownership in Ireland, particularly Dublin where I\u2019m from is a funny one. It\u2019s impossible on the average salary. \n\nI feel hopeless when I think about a future here. I work 2 jobs so as a young person I\u2019m not really living. I would describe it more like existing and surviving. I work one job during the day 9-5, take a 1 hour 30 minute break then head to the next job. My day job is alright but the night job breaks my soul going in. I just go for the extra pay. I won\u2019t talk about how my heart breaks when I see how tax slices up the little extra money I make but it goes to show that the little extra I make is badly needed.\n\nAs I know I wanna move abroad and start a new life, since I\u2019m being forced out of the city and country essentially, I\u2019ve been saving to buy a house and also saving for other security purposes. My plan is to hold on to my savings and buy when I\u2019m certain of a city abroad I wanna live in going forward.\n\nI don\u2019t shop for clothes unless it\u2019s a necessity. For example, I bought an outfit for graduation last year but returned it afterwards as I really need the money saved. I haven\u2019t shopped for clothes since then. I\u2019ll buy the odd new pair of socks or leggings in Penney\u2019s if the previous ones look old every few months. I don\u2019t go out on weekends as much as I\u2019m too tired after returning from work late at night 3 days out of the week whilst still doing my main early start job.\n\nI recently started allowing myself to do nails but before that it was a solid no as I needed to save.\n\nMy one treat has been take aways as it makes me feel better after working so much.\n\nMoney is something I worry about all the time and the pressure of being 25 and not having enough or even more than enough money scares me. I\u2019ve always been in the habit of saving but I feel greater pressure than ever now at 25.\n\nI don\u2019t really have the privilege to enjoy being young. At least that\u2019s what it feels like.\n\nI would love to read about similar situations or any hardship anyone might be going through as a young person in a similar situation as me. I think it would make me feel better, especially as I\u2019m feeling extra shit today. \n\nSure let\u2019s all cry together \ud83d\ude2d."

I've seen 4kg bags on sale for as high as E90+. \n\nI'm looking for a high quality cat food that is mostly high quality meats (so, that rules out most commercial brands, which are stuffed with grain). Also, bulk wild bird food that isn't just all cheap pigeon food.\n\nFinally, if you're still reading (sorry to come off as a bit needy but I'm beyond frustrated), I've noticed a number of Irish companies that sell raw food for pets. Does anyone have any experience of this with cats in Ireland? Is it any good? How's the bulk shipping?\n\nThanks for any input."

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a 28-year-old single professional working in the tech industry. I'm currently living with my parents and looking to purchase my own property. However, the soaring house prices in Ireland have made it difficult for me to afford a new build, even with the first homes scheme being out of reach due to the high asking prices.\n\nGiven these circumstances, I'm contemplating shifting my focus towards second-hand apartments. Initially, I had my sights set on a one-bedroom apartment. However, I recently discovered that a 20% down payment is required for such a property. With some calculations, I realized that if I consider a two-bedroom apartment instead, (and saving what would be 20% for a 1 bed), I could potentially find something within my budget near my current location.\n\nThis would be my first experience living in an apartment, and I'm unsure if it's a decision I might regret. On the other hand, purchasing a house seems to be a minimum of three years away, considering the rapidly rising prices. Fortunately, being in the tech industry, I anticipate a significant salary increase in a couple of years, which would enable me to afford a house at that point.\n\nI'm seeking advice from the community: does this plan seem unwise, or should I go ahead with purchasing the apartment? I appreciate any insights or suggestions you may have.\n\nThank you!"

        "text": "This will be my second post on this topic, but due to the (almost certainly fake) thread gaining huge numbers of upvotes, I just want to push back from the other side. \n\nI have spoken in length about my life being disabled in Ireland, the Catch 22 system that prevents you from getting most of the imagined benefits that some believe are thrown out willy nilly. I won\u2019t go over it too much again. I will say, it is a very tough life, with little or no prospects of ever improving. Imagine living in our current economic situation, but on top of that, every time you get a job, before you make it off probation, you spend weeks to months in a hospital bed as they try everything under the sun to fix you. Some ask why bother working? Some of us ask why bother living?\n\nPeople with disabilities are highest priority on the housing list, and yet 9/10 of us will never get a house. So when you see a woman with young children getting a \u201cfree house\u201d, \u201cjust handed to her\u201d, there\u2019s a good chance her kids or herself are suffering from ill health. Raising kids is hard enough without relying on so-called handouts. Some might say that the social welfare somehow makes it easier, well I would imagine that in addition to the low income, they know what you say about them. They know you look at them and hate them for what they have. They know the other mams in the school whisper about the money they get for books and uniforms. Everyone I know who has ever been on social welfare supports has reported the same outcome- intense depression. \n\nIt makes me laugh, and it also makes me sick, to see how the recipients of SW are divvied up between deserving and undeserving. Jobseekers, worst of the worst, disabled, deserving but a nuisance to the upstanding taxpayer. People who collected, for 2 years, almost double the normal rate in PUP- excellent, moral people, with goodness in their hearts. It was such a slap in the face not just to people on welfare, but specifically the disabled, to say that it would be cruel to make office workers and civil servants (who statistically have far more savings and assets) to live on anything less than \u20ac350 a week. Meanwhile, not now, not even for the duration of the pandemic, were people paralysed, or unable to see, or unable to leave a hospital bed to go to work, given more than \u20ac220 a week- up from 208.\n\nHAP is open to people who work. In fact, most people who get help from the state with housing are employed! Should you be sticking your nose between your neighbour\u2019s curtains, asking what the slut single mother- since let\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s what a lot of this boils down to- is doing with the money? Or should you be sticking your nose into the business of billionaires, of corporations, of those people who are constantly siphoning money away from society as a whole, and depositing it into the pockets of shareholders, offshore bank accounts, dubious \u201ccharities\u201d and the rest? Should you be expending your energy freaking out about one person living a life you have drawn up in your mind, or about the things in society we know for sure are happening? Can you be positive this woman is happy and easy going? Well I can be positive that the failures of CAMHS have resulted in the death of children. I can be positive the HSE shambles has resulted in the death of a sixteen year old girl.\n\nThe people who caused the above are so, so happy that you are taking your frustrations out on the unsuspecting single mother. The more individualist, more competitive, more focused on the poor we are, the less we pay attention to the enormous robbers at the top. The ones who got on the radio to abuse and harass those on PUP, when they took thousands of employee\u2019s worth of government loans for their business. The ones who sell off state companies that were making us a profit, the ones who create policies that increase house prices despite being warned, but claim this is them helping the housing crisis. \n\nTo find your problems, look up, not down."

        "title": "Better solutions for the housing crisis",
        "text": "The government is trying to solve the housing crisis by incentivising more building. This is the most expensive and ineffective route.\n\nThere are potentially many vacant houses and apartments throughout the country, including in Dublin city. They can be vacant for many reasons; including dilapidation and bad location. And including investors leaving them empty in large numbers, in order to create a shortage, to push up the prices of their other properties.\n\nFirst, the government must find the vacant housing, by comparing the list of domiciles on the Property Registry with people's addresses from the PPS registry. It must tax the owners of vacant properties, forcing the owners to ulitise, develop or sell them.\n\nThen the government must prevent investment funds from owning residential property. It has been proposed to increase the tax rental businesses pay, but it is too late for that now. Only a total ban on businesses (non-people) from property ownership will suffice, to free up the amount of housing needed today for new home-owners and private landlords. Exceptions like universities, housing cooperatives and doctors' offices can apply for a licence to own housing.\n\nIf those measures are not enough, there is more that must be done before resorting to large scale building. A policy of gradually lowering the mortgage term limit (currently 35 years) is needed to keep house prices stable. It reduces the amount people can borrow, which reduces house prices proportionately. This makes housing a bad investment (unless you plan to live in the house) and a very bad investment if you plan to leave the house empty. This an extension of the existing macroprudential policy advocated by the central bank.\n\nPlanning regulation changes are needed too. Building offices in cities with housing shortages must only be permitted alongside the construction of a greater number of housing units. Building housing in an area with few jobs must only be permitted alongside the construction of employers like offices and retail. This not only ensures housing is built where it is needed, and reduces prices in pressure areas. It also reduces commuting distances and road traffic, and the need for new public transport infrastructure.\n\nAs things stand, more construction is not an effective way to resolve the housing crisis. The above structural problems must be solved first.\n\nThese new estates now being built are simply creating problems for tomorrow. They are consuming Ireland's countryside and vital arable land. They are creating transportation and social problems due to their isolation from the towns. The big build policy only serves the desires of developers, not the people."

There was no written agreement for the house and it was offered as an act of charity.\n\nHe says that on Thursday he got a call from the person who \"rents\" the house saying that the \"owner\" of the house has decided to demand they start paying rent within 24-48 hours and sign a rental agreement(1500 per month, which is about 300 above the market price for the area) or they will have to vacate immediately.\n\nThey also said they are happy to have the government cover 800 (which I've checked and is legit) but they will have to pay the remainder.\n\nHe has not been able to source who the *actual* owner of the house is and believes that they are being blackmailed /scammed.\nNo specifics are been given and they are been refused written notice explaining any details.\n\nHe suspects that this hotel owner might be claiming payments from the government for the Ukrainians in the hotel but now seeking rent from the people who have been rehoused to somewhere else and possibly withholding this information to the government?\n\nRegardless, to me, the whole thing seems super dodge and obviously a horrendous situation for the poor lad.\n It's worth noting that he said he also has several Ukrainian friends who have suddenly been told the same thing (all of whom were offered houses arranged by this hotel owner).\n\nHe was clearly very stressed and has no idea where to turn to in terms of support on the matter so he was asking me if I might know.\n\nI offered to help in any way I could but genuinely was a bit unaware of what can be done from a legal standpoint abd there are so many red flags in the what he has been told..\nHis family aren't tenants, so from what I gather , aren't entitled to those rights. \n\nHowever, I assumed all refugees that were offered accommodation had a written agreement in place with whomever  offered them accommodation, but this doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nHe has assured me that the hotel owner had been receiving payments from the government (including utility bills) so it sounds like there is a paper trail of *some* description.\n\nDoes anyone know what he can do in this situation?"

What the lockdowns and Covid years have shown me is that I do not want to live in an estate long term (even a nice one). My ideal is a small home with a small plot of land where I can have privacy and a bit of solitude to escape to. Grow some veg maybe and aim to become energy independent.\n\nI have a good deposit saved, but I don't want to buy a \"first home\" or \"starter home\". I want to buy a potential \"forever home\" not be on a \"ladder\". That property ladder is what is messing up housing imo along with the obvious shortage. The constant need for value to increase so that you can move up is unrelenting and unsustainable. \n\nThe government has greatly subsidised buying new homes. To such an extent that you can potentially get 100k off the mortgage price of a new build. (Which has lead to price increases too). But there is nothing available to subsidise the purchase in the second hand market or one off homes.\n\nYou also cannot decide to build a new one off house in the Dublin commuter belt due to the illegal \"Local Needs\" constraints (Deemed illegal by EU courts) imposed by the local councils and you are up against those same councils who outbid you on the second hand market for the social home needs. Again further pushing up prices and reducing stock. \n\nSome possible answers! \n\u2022Remove local needs constraints \n\u2022Speed up planning application process\n\u2022Reduce VAT on building supplies\n\u2022Reduce Stamp Duty\n\u2022Give same tax back options to 2nd hand home purchases as they do for new builds\n\n\nRant over!

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nLooking for any legal advice you may have on the situation our apartment estate has landed in. Our management company just gave us the 3 weeks required notice for this year's AGM to vote on the proposed management fee increase from last year of 70 - 78% depending on the type of apartment.\n\nWe are certain much of the increase is due to a fire that destroyed 1 apartment and requires on going remediation works to secure the rest of the apartments in that building from moisture damage, and to totally rebuild the destroyed apartment. This is very unfortunate for all involved - also the management company was ruthless in now they handled. However, it is now a huge shock to us that we are to foot the bill for this. They must have underinsured and now we have to pay? We also question how the remediation and rebuilding works were put out to tender. The work started so quickly it seems it was not put out to tender and the bid was immediately given to a company friendly with the management company.\n\nAnother caveat, the houses in the estate pay a much smaller management fee - \u20ac500 vs \u20ac2200 last year. Their fee has only gone up by 2%, not even close to being in line with inflation. Yet their votes at the AGM will effect budgeting of apartments just as much as apartment owners themselves, yet they don't have to pay for any of it. Apartment blocks seem to have to foot the bill for a fire in a completely different block, but not the houses, yet they get a say? Something doesn't add up there.\n\nDiscussions precipitated by the proposed price hike also uncovered that a unknown quantity of apartments are under the custody of the management company via a renting agency, so they are either owned by the management company or the developers. This means those votes will either be on the management companies side automatically, or will be abstained (uncertainty). Additionally, households that are in arrears of managment fees can have their voting rights removed.\n\nFor this new fee to be successfully opposed at the upcoming AGM a No vote of >75% is needed. Considering the above, the voting route seems like a totally unwinnable battle. In the face of what is very likely a rigged voting system, alongside questionable spending and tendering behavior, lead us to think that a legal route might be our best avenue to stop this unacceptable budget increase, and to completely redraw the budgeting appartus going forward.\n\nWhat legal avenues might we be able to pursue? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

The realtor seemed very young, and he mentioned this was the very first viewing he did. Lovely guy but clearly new to it all.\n\nHe mentioned (without us asking) nearly right away that there was an offer made this morning for 15K more than the asking price. He also said the landlord is looking for a quick sale.\nHe sounded a little shy or hesitant in it all but that might just be his personality.\n\n15K above the asking price would be too much for us, we simply can\u2019t afford that.\nI\u2019m wondering if we are able to ask for some sort of proof that the other offer has actually been made?\n\nI\u2019m thinking it may have been a sales trick he was told to use since he said it to us nearly right away, and also since he said they\u2019re looking for a quick sale.\nIf that\u2019s the case and an offer for 15K over asking price came in, then why didn\u2019t they take that right away?\nIs there any chance they waited since we were coming to view it too, but the offer is real?\n\nAny help or insights would be appreciated since I am new to all of this.\n\nThank you!"

I don't know what the average price to build a house (and associated costs of land/labour) would be but let's try a couple examples:\n\n\u20ac250,000 x 50,000 houses = \u20ac12.5b a year.\n\n\u20ac300,000 x 50,000 houses = \u20ac15b a year.\n\n\u20ac350,000 x 50,000 houses = \u20ac17.5b a year.\n\nIs this realistic and do we have this kind of funding?\n\nAgainst that it's taken the current government about \u20ac2b to build one children's hospital so does it really seem like a lot.\n\nAnd where would you build these houses. You'd probably need to be putting about 40% (20,000) in Dublin, then about 15% (7,500) in greater Leinster, 25% (12,500) Munster, 20% (10,000) Connacht/Ulster.\n\nWe can say it's all pie in the sky figures but there is a problem and it needs a solution."

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a 19 year old and I'm not sure what to do anymore about my abusive parents. They used to beat me regularly and leave bruises and even cuts. I've gone to the Garda\u00ed on two occasions (When I was 12 and 16) but absolutely nothing was done, and the first time I had to walk a mile to the station barefoot because my mother took my shoes to prevent me from leaving. Even though my parents were called to the station and talked to by the guards, and the guards promised they would send social workers, non ever arrived. My parents even joke about the incident now. They've even gone as far to say things like \"the law shouldn't cover people you\".\n\nAlthough they don't beat me anymore (the last time being when I was around 17 when my father punched my in the face and kicked my stomach repeatedly when I was on the ground), they find other methods to abuse me such as constant verbal abuse and locking me out of the house when I upset them, sometimes for even the most minor infractions such as coming home later the time I told them I would. I was locked out for two weeks over the summer, but thankfully I was able to stay at a friend's apartment temporarily. The second time, I had to sleep rough in a park for four days. Another example is that when I saved up enough money from work to buy my own computer, they took it when I was out of the house and refused to give it back to me and I was forced to sell it. These are just a fraction of the things they've managed to put me through.\n\nI'm not sure what to do anymore, I feel like I've exhausted all options. I'm 19 so I'm adult but I still live with my parents so I don't even know what the law covers and what they'll even do. I can't move out as it's impossible with the current housing prices especially in Dublin. I don't want to live in fear of my own parents and I don't want to continue being a victim of their abuse. I would appreciate any advice or suggestions on how to deal with this situation. Thank you in advance."

        "text": "I know nobody should be surprised by atrocious service from just about any company these days, but holy moly. This is a combination of cautionary tale and moan in to the void, so do with it as you will! \n\nI contacted Virgin in mid-August to cancel my internet service, as they were gouging me for internet which was cutting out on video calls about twice every hour anyway. Had to give 30 days notice, no bother - one more normal bill, then a partial bill for the extra few days. I received a full bill, then a smaller one, as expected. (Interestingly, my account shows that smaller payment as being made, but does NOT show any bill issued). \n\nFast forward to October, and I receive a bill for 2 months of service. I raise a complaint, and they admit that (of course), they failed to cancel my account as instructed. Good thing I cancelled the direct debit on my side, right? Well, only kinda, as it would turn out. \n\nNext thing I know I get ANOTHER bill, albeit smaller. They backdated my cancellation...to the wrong date. At this stage, it was mid-November. Work is mad busy. I'm trying to get Christmas presents in early. The whole house is down with viruses of various types. I leave the bill, resolving to give out to them when they contact me about this \"unpaid\" bill. Who has the time to be constantly on the phone to these dopes, much less when \"we are experiencing high call volumes, you are number 29 in the queue\" is what greets you?\n\nWell, this is where cancelling the direct debit was an issue. I would have had to take time and chase them to get my money back, but that might have been better than what happened. Without anyone getting in touch with me by phone, email, text, letter, or anything else, this \"debt\" (which I did not owe in the first place) was passed to ~~criminal thugs~~ a debt collection agency. Queue a series of emails and texts threatening and harassing me. I paid, because I like having unbroken thumbs and kneecaps. I still received texts threatening me and saying I had not paid, they eventually stopped. Immediately contacted Virgin after paying. Their operator said very little except, yes, it was an error, and yes, you will be \"refunded in January\". \n\n2 weeks out from Christmas I'm on some dirtbag's hitlist. I don't think a refund is going to cut it. Is this on record somewhere if I try to take out a loan?! \"You'll get a refund\". Great. \n\nNow, worth mentioning here is that I cancelled my phone account at the same time, and they owed ME money. I was issued a cheque for that. The difference between what I supposedly owed them, and what they ACTUALLY owed me? ...7 euro. Even if the bill was real, could they not have kept the phone balance and called it quits? Over 7 quid. \n\nNot to mention, I was a customer of theirs for 4 years prior to this, and never missed a single payment on either account. \n\nI've moved over to Eir, who thus far have at least got good internet at a lower price. No doubt when I go to cancel I'll end up in a ditch somewhere."

        "text": "Hi Guys, myself and my partner are after getting our 6 month notice from our landlord that they intend on selling the house. Everything on her end is done correctly and to be fair she is very apologetic about the situation. I can't blame her for wanting to sell with the way house prices are and she has always been good to us.\n\nHowever, this leaves us in quite a predicament as the  rental market has soared since we moved in to this house and if we were to rent another place the cheapest around is double what we are paying now. As two 24 year olds we don't fancy paying upwards of \u20ac18k per year dead money. I'm only a 2nd year apprentice so I couldn't afford it anyways (although I'm apparently earning too much to qualify for HAP or any other assistance). Moving home simply isn't an option for either of us as I'm 200km from my home town and her parents haven't got the room.\n\nWe're looking at the possibility of trying to convince her grandparents to allow us put a mobile home out the back of their house but don't know where to go from there really. We're both fairly well clued in and understand it's not that simple as have to get electricity brought to the house etc. We're both starting from scratch as we could never afford to save money while renting and paying bills so we don't have a lot of money to play around with.\n\nIf anyone has any tips, words of advise or a spare acre they would like to share it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n2 Future Statistics"

Well this is inherently wrong, and being legal doesnt mean anything. If I cared enough I'd investigate who is connected to who in BAM and how much they're making. Who owns what shell companies that hold a stock, and of course who gets the fabled brown envelope at the end of the day.\n\n3.2 billion euros for a hospital, and we're all paying for it.

No certificate of compliance with building regs and they won't be giving us one.\n\nThe issue is that it seems they didn't use any steel joists and the internal walls are wood so the attic isn't properly supported. There's also some cracking on the front walls which is likely caused by the extra weight/pressure on the outside walls. \n\nI've asked a few places for quotes on remediation but haven't heard back. Does anyone know what might be involved in fixing an issue like this? Or how much it might end up costing? Still waiting to see what the bank says about it too. Solicitor said it might cause an issue their end."

        "text": "Hello Redditors. I have an issue and Im not sure what to do. For the last 6 months of last year I was suffering with unusually high blood pressure and headaches. Went to GP a few times and ended up on blood pressure tablets. I had been back to the GP's about 7 times over this issue for 24 BP monitors and even ended up in accident and emergency back in October die to being a stroke risk over how high my BP was. Then at the start of October I was heading into Dublin on the dart and ended up fainting. Couldn't get a doctor in Dublin right after because I wasn't a registered patient and I didnt go to the hospital because I wasn't prepared to spend 12 hours sitting around waiting to be told that there was nothing wrong with me. Went to the GP the following weekend and as I have health insurance from work he said I would be better off getting a complete medical assessment in the Bons Secuors in Cork. \n\nThe GP initially told me this would cost whatever my excess is.\n\nThe hospital rang me and told me that Id have to pay 330 on the day and then Id get a bill for another 220 at a later date.\n\nI went in to the assessment unit and paid the 330 so they could start doing there tests. They did loads of tests on the Thursday and then I did an MRI on the Friday morning. I was then told that I had to wear different monitors for the duration of my stay. My assigned consultant then said it would be best if I stuck around to see a neurologist just to rule out that there was nothing messed up in my brain that caused the faint. It was two days later that he turned up so I was literally sat there for 48 hours waiting for him to turn up. \n\nSkip forward to this week and I have recieved a letter from my health insurance advising that me staying in the hospital for so long was unnecessary so they aren't covering any of it and they have sent me an invoice from the hospital for 4 grand.\n\nI've no idea what to do. Ive to ring them this morning to see what the story is but everything I did was under medical advise whiles there. I had zero say in tests done and how long I was kept there. I even brought one change of cloths with me because I was told I would most likely have to stay for a night. I asked a nurse on Saturday evening if I could leave to go buy some cloths so I could be wearing something clean and I was told that I wasn't permitted to leave the building by my insurance company so I was actually being held there until I was given the all clear.\n\nI've no idea what to do. 4 grand is more money than I've ever had to my name in my life. In fact, because of the cost of living Im actually about 2k worse off than I was this time last year. \n\nHas anyone here had a similar experience or would anyone know what my next best steps are? Any advice greatly appreciated.\n\nTl;dr I was sent to the hospital for a medical assessment under my insurance by my GP,  the hospital kept me there for days doing tests and waiting on a specialist to come to work, insurance said me staying was unnecessary, now Im stuck with an astronomical medical bill."

Naturally this sparked a conversation about other times the office ventured out as a group and someone mentioned The Incident (from long before my time in the office). \n\nBasically there was a dinner as a farewell a few years ago and the bill came to about \u20ac500 for the group of ten. Naturally the guest of honour didn\u2019t pay and everyone added a few euro for their meal and proceeded to divvy up the rest of the bill\u2026except one woman who put in the money for the guest of honour but who then paid \u20ac25 for herself because she only had a main and a coke and she doesn\u2019t drink at all so she didn\u2019t see why she should have to pay double for the others to have wine and desserts with their dinner. The \u20ac25 she paid covered her dinner and drink and left money over for a tip, but she was absolutely slated for not putting in the full \u20ac50. She has forever been labelled as *tight* and that\u2019s apparently worse than murder! \n\nHalf of the office feel this was a serious faux pas and the height of bad manners but the other half think she was right to pay for what she had and not add in the extra \u20ac25. \n\nWe have been informed that on the night in question the bill will be divided evenly and if you choose to not have wine/dessert/extras, that\u2019s your problem. I ended up making my excuses to cancel because office politics are tricky enough without adding social affairs and I wouldn\u2019t be able to drink anyway unless I wanted to spend an extra \u20ac60 on a taxi or stay in a hotel so paying for everyone else\u2019s drinks leaves me feeling deflated and I\u2019d probably be pretty annoyed by forking over double what my meal cost!\n\nSo Reddit, tell me what you think? Am I being stingy or would you feel the same?\n\nEditing to add: There is also a small in office do for the entire building, paid for by the bosses, where the leaver will have catered sandwiches/cakes/nibbles and will be presented with flowers and a gift. The meal/drinks out is like an informal thing that\u2019s just for our office because we worked closely with the person leaving. Attendance is optional (but not really because office politics dictates if we aren\u2019t there we are seen as snubbing the guest of honour). I have made my excuses and bowed out but I will probably put \u20ac20 towards a round in order to not be the office tightarse!"

        "title": "Ukrainian perspective on housing crisis",
        "text": "Ukrainian refugees here. It really feels in here that economy is booming unironically. But as for now I want to address housing crisis:\n\nHalf a million for a house is really badass. In post soviet countries families of 4 live in two-bedroom flats. Couples of 2 live in a one-bedroom flat and 1 lonely man enjoys a studio. 50k-100k for a good 2-bedroom flat in the center of Kyiv (capital city). Rent is like 300eur per month + 50-100eur for water+electricity. And because of war house prices has fallen for around 15-20%.\n\nFor that I am really shocked is that people just live in big houses in Dublin centre. It really has great charm and it's nice to have a small garden but isn't that a suburban living advantages? Like in USA or more functional eu cities, where city is just skyscrapers with lots of accommodations and business centres, while industrial buildings have their own districts and mid-class enjoys housing in a sleepy suburbans? My gf family has a house in 20km from Kyiv and it takes 30min-1hour to get to job by car and it's approx 300-500euro taxes for gas, water and electricity. I lived with mom, granny and my gf in 2 bedroom flat in Kyiv. It might not sound very prestigious, but with my salary of 400eur per month I had to pay only 50-70eur taxes for all of my family.\n\nMy point is that a big amount of houses prevents cities from developing as centers of businesses for the people. If there were more flats and high buildings that use vertical space in the Dublin city itself it would lower the housing prices significantly. But what I do understand that I can't offer any good fast solution, except for radical ones - to take from the rich, confiscate houses and relocate people, destroy historical buildings and city planning (which was actually done in the Soviet Union, but for what cost...?)\n\nThe way we used to progress in Kyiv before Russian invasion was like this - government created good conditions for building companies to build whatever they want. At first it was shopping malls everywhere (I had four really big ones in 10 minutes walk from home). Then they began building houses, taking investments from government, city hall and regular people (like you pay money now and get a house as soon as they build it). It involved corruption, tax frauds and shady connections but it was not complete freedom. People protested if companies delayed buildings terms, tried to destroy some cool historical stuff or just didn't built parks around for people to have a bit of nature. Yes, government took more pro-capitalist approach in this sphere but when something really bad happened (I do not mean destroying historical buildings or churches, etc - it all was sacrificed for progress) they always took a people's side. When company my family invested in 7 years ago went bankrupt in 2020 we protested near city hall for several days and it resulted to take over of that company by the government. By now most of their buildings has been already finished (including our apartment) even though the company didn't got big profits.\n\nI don't want to offend anyone - Dublin is amazing. It really feels like a promised land for me and I want to become a part of Irish society (that's why I decided to start this discussion). But there are only harsh solutions for fixing housing problem in 5-10 years. And that means even more transformations for the state, which not all would like.\n\nIreland is really having an economic boom. You have megacorporations, workforce from EU (including myself), decent standards of living and the connections with whole world - from USA and UK to Asia and Middle East! That is something that was just a dream for Ukraine. Yes, there are high tax rates, housing crisis and God knows what ahead, but you can go anywhere in a world, knowing that you're among equals or even superior. \n\nIf you won't hate me for this post I might address other issues that interest me, because I want to get a deeper knowledge of you (yes, personally you!) via discussion."

This is going to bring us back to short term solutions, to having big housing estates at the edges, or even beyond, our cities and towns. We know that will take us down planning, community, infrastructure and environmental culs-de-sac.\"\n\nHe's making valid points. Whether it's reducing standards on energy ratings, or allowing building to take place out on the very edges of towns, away from infrastructure, it all comes back to bite us in the arse. We pay for it one way or another, and just because we've a housing disaster, doesn't mean we should shoot first, pay double later."

John Lahart is still the only TD to reply to my questions, however Paul Murphy did take 2 of my questions to the housing minister and has provided the below response. \n\nI sent a follow up email to the below 3 TDs and have still not had a response of acknowledgement.\n\n* Se\u00e1n Crowe (Sinn F\u00e9in)\n* Colm Brophy (Fine Gael)\n* Francis Noel Duffy (Green Party)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\\* To ask the Minister for Housing; Local Government and Heritage if an alternative plan been drawn up in relation to the \u20ac450 million State fund which was launched to lease 1,000 new-build homes for social housing, including the direct building of social housing on State land; and if so, the estimated number of units that could be provided for the same amount.*\n\n*- Paul Murphy T.D.*  \n\n\n*\\* To ask the Minister for Housing; Local Government and Heritage if he is of the view that long-term leases are an effective use of public money and a sustainable solution to the lack of social housing in relation to the \u20ac450 million State fund which has been launched to lease 1,000 new-build homes for social housing.*\n\n*- Paul Murphy T.D.*\n\n***REPLY***\n\n*As a necessary measure to accelerate the provision of social homes and to alleviate pressure on the wider housing system this year; the Housing Agency in conjunction with my Department is exploring the introduction of a new emergency targeted leasing initiative.*\n\n*On 15 July, a without prejudice call for expressions of interest was published on* [*www.etenders.gov.ie*](http://www.etenders.gov.ie/)*, to test the market\u2019s ability to deliver up to an additional 1,000 social homes between 2022 and 2025.*\n\n*This new targeted leasing initiative is designed to provide greater value for money to the state than existing standard leasing. It aims to secure a greater discount than standard leasing (currently up to 20% market rent discount). It also explores the financial feasibility of long-term ownership of the homes at the end of the lease term by means of asset transfer at the greatest possible open market value discount. Expression of interest submissions will be assessed and ranked against a number of criteria, the top one being value for money.*\n\n*The outputs from the project submissions will enable an accurate cost analysis to be completed to determine the exact funds required to progress this initiative, which will then be assessed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for funding approval.* \u00a0\n\n*Housing for All commits to ending long term leasing by 2025 year end. This policy remains unchanged, however leasing continues to be an important mechanism for faster delivery to meet social housing needs as build supply ramps up to meet demand.*"

        "text": "Hear me out: I know the normal the automatic reaction is \"We can't do that!\" Well let's just question that assumption for two minutes. What would it take to host a World Cup, and what do we have?\n\n* The first objection you always heard was **we're too small to host a World Cup**. Well that objection is scriosta now. We are 7.23 times bigger than the current host. https://old.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/z6e0ab/qatar_wc_stadiums_locations_mapped_out_around/\n\n* Our small size is an advantage, not a detriment. The players and fans will have quicker travel times. A big event concentrated in a small space will create a deadly atmosphere; the whole country will be World Cup mad for months. Here is the [PDF](https://web.archive.org/web/20101214044951/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/01/33/74/52/b5ruse.pdf) of FIFA's report on Russia's 2018 bid; Ctrl+F 'travel' or 'travel time', and you'll see that compact size is considered a big advantage.\n\n* So if it's not size that stops us, then what is it? Must be money or infrastructure. Well no host ever had the infrastructure when they made the bid; you make the bid and then build&upgrade infrastructure. \n\n* **Money**: according to [this](https://www.newarab.com/news/no-qatar-has-not-spent-220-billion-world-cup-stadiums), **Russia spent $11.6 billion to host the World Cup, Brazil spent $15 billion**. (Qatar's spend is disputed and I'll leave it out.)\n\n* **What does it actually take to host a World Cup, in terms of stadia?** Germany [had](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup#Venues) 12 stadia of capacity 41-72k. South Africa [had](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup#Venues) ten with capacity 40,911 to 84,490. Brazil [had 12 venues (seven new and five renovated)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup#Venues), the smallest 39,631 and the biggest 74,738. Russia [hosted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup#Venues) with 12 stadia and \"Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament\". Qatar [is hosting with just 8 stadia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#Venues) the smallest 44,325 and the largest 88,966\n\n* **[We already have five stadia that are World Cup sized!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stadiums_in_Ireland_by_capacity)**. Croker holds 82,300, and that's MORE than attended the [2014 final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup_Final) and [2018 final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_Final). Five isn't enough, but most hosts don't start with enough when they make the bid. We just saw that South Africa built seven and renovated five, Russia built nine.\n\n* Yes, Croker and the others have hosted foreign sports for 15 years now.\n\n* Another point I want to pull out from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#Venues is \"the upper tiers of the stadiums will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure\". **This answers the objection that \"arrah we don't want to build all those stadia that we'd never use afterwards\"**\n\n* Hosting a World Cup will be an impetus for building rail and other infrastructure. This infrastructure would serve us into the future. Good infrastructure is a long-term economic stimulus, in addition to the short-term cash injection.\n\n* **Economic impacts of hosting a World Cup**: [this article](https://www.supplier.io/blog/economic-impact-of-hosting-a-world-cup) quotes a 2010 FIFA presentation that the 2006 World Cup brought \u20ac2.86 billion to Germany, generated \u20ac104 million in tax, created 50k jobs for eight months, and boosted GDP 0.3%; it goes on to discuss a consulting firms analysis of the 2026 World Cup, including \u20ac1 billion in earnings. [This mentions](https://angeloueconomics.com/keep-up-with-ae/understanding-the-economic-impact-of-hosting-the-fifa-world-cup/) that Qatar was expected to rake in $20 billion from hosting, later revised down to $17 billion.\n\n* It raises our [soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power)\n\n**TL;DR**: We are a nice, compact country. We have half the stadia and building the other half is the norm. We are a rich country and it only costs $10-15 billion. That's gross outlay, net figures would be positive with a bit of luck. It'd give us infrastructure. We'd also qualify for the feckin thing for a change.\n\nThanks for listening, I trust you'll vote for me."

Although it hasn't been lived in for a few years, with some cleaning, DIY jobs etc it would be possible to move in soon. However, long term it requires more TLC (new windows, maybe insulation etc). We were hoping to perhaps add an extension of 40m2 to make an open plan living room/kitchen and a bedroom. At present it has two box rooms, a kitchenette and a toilet. Outside, the garden needs some work (which we could do ourselves) but the house needs a septic tank. (Prev tank on neighbors property!) Just wondering if anyone knows roughly how much this sorta job would cost. We seem to be getting mixed msgs, some saying \u20ac1350m2 exc. VAT for extension while others are saying with building and septic tank it could be \u20ac200k!!! Our budget is a lot smaller than that! \ud83e\udd23we Really would love this project to work out so we appreciate any advice \ud83d\ude00"

Just the last few bits.\n\nUnfortunately our painter let us down two weeks before he was due to start. His price went up from 12500 to 18000 with no change to the spec and he didn't elaborate or want to negotiate so we cut ties.\n\nSince then I priced another painter. Labour only 12000. I supply the paint which is about 3k. \n\nNow I'm fully aware I'm overpaying on the painting. The price in the original tender was something the builder was making a margin on and I didn't have much option but to accept it at the time. And then the potential replacement painter I found is about the same on the price. But still basically ending up earning over 1k per day.\n\nAnyway today I'd another painter come out to quote the job. Just to see. And his quote was 4000 labour only and I'd need to hire him a cherry picker to paint outside walls. \n\nNow usually I know the adage is not to go with the cheapest quote, but I feel like the other painters are taking the piss a bit. When you really break down their margin. They're earning more than any other trade on the site at the moment if I go with the the higher price. And I had a number of other painters estimating the 12-18k cost.\n\nAnyway, usually I'd take ages to make a decision here but I'm thinking going with the cheaper guy who's available to start this week is better than the very expensive guy who won't start for months."

We're getting screwed mostly by incompetent governments and general inefficiencies and an unwillingness to change or invest in change until the shit has already hit the fan. \n\nI'm fucking sick of it. Here's a big list of things I've thrown into a wee txt document over the weeks. I'm sure there's more. Feel free to throw in things you'd want to see change, or point out the glaring idiocy of some of my ramblings.\n\n1 Economy and Employment\n\n* Raise minimum wage\n* Implement Universal Basic Income\n* Outlaw zero hours contracts\n* Stricter controls on hiring process, companies cannot lie or mislead on a job specification and must give some indication of salary scale\n* Enforce a balance between inflation rates and interest rates to combat runaway inflation\n\n\n\n2 Energy, resources and agriculture\n\n* Update regulation to ensure new builds use modern, renewable technologies (i.e heat pumps for heating, adequite insulation, solar panels and battery units, rebates for returning excess electricity to the grid, water collection and treatment systems)\n* Large amount of funding for the older properties to do the above.\n* Roll out more wind, solar and other renewable sources. We cannot rely on others to provide Ireland with it's energy requirements at a competitive rate.\n* Funding for modernisation of farms, including building of facilities that allow for large scale cultivation of produce that would otherwise be imported.\n* Decriminalisation of drugs and allowing farmers to grow marijuana. (more to follow on that topic)\n\n\n3 Rent and property\n\n* Rent caps\n* Zoning central urban areas for higher density buildings, especially for residential buildings. \n* Stronger compulsory property purchase rules to enable urban development and transport development\n* Increase capacity with small single unit for 1-2 adults (think Boxabl housing) at a locked in, affordable rate. Suitable for those who are studying, working minimum wage. Should also ease pressure on private rental stock.\n* Legislate a legal requirement for Estate Agents to have a complete and requestable offer history.\n\n\n4 Transport and Infrastructure\n\n* No more HGV in urban areas, fund distribution centres that can be used by suppliers to use smaller (possibly electrified) vehicles. HGVs are often the source of road damage, which is not only a huge cost to the state but to private vehicle owners as it increases \nwear and tear\n* Property developers should be liable for repairs to roads, footpaths and other infrastructure that is degraded over the course of building a development\n* Planned works that involves digging up roads or streets need to be planned and applied for well in advance, all jobs can be completed at once and streets relaid until the next cycle of work is available. Too often streets are freshly laid only to be pulled up less than a year later. A colossal waste of money.\n* Electrification of intercity rail with the view of HSR later\n* Push the Metro project forward\n* Fund and modernise public transport in urban areas outside Dublin\n* Towns and villages that are planning to grow at an exponential rate must have infrastructure planning and contracts secured before building of large developments can proceed. \n* Airport curfews, flights can only enter or leave within specific times\n\n\n5 Healthcare\n\n* Complete overhaul of the HSE, it will be costly to remove the bloat but it'll be even more costly to allow it to stay in the long term\n* Why are private entities allowed to provide services in public hospitals?\n* Push forward with universal heathcare (Slaintecare is a good start)\n* A huge amount of work is required in the mental health sector, especially after the pandemic\n* Addiction treatment needs to be modernised\n* I.T services need a huge amount of investment, although the HSE is not the only body that requires modernisation\n\n6 Policing and law\n\n* Decriminalisation of drugs in small quantities\n* Legalisation of Marijuana with strict controls on who can grow and sell, this is an opportunity to cut off a revenue stream to drug gangs. Legislate appropriately. Personal growers can have 3-5 plants growing at one time.\n* Investment in Gardai, reopen rural stations and provide modern technology infrastructure throughout the country\n* Bodycams must be mandatory\n* Overhaul of the prison system which is clearly not working, addicts who are offenders need specific care. Repeat juvenile offenders need specific care.\n* Harsher sentences for violent crimes\n* Allow those in the prison system an opportunity to complete work for minimum wage\n* Offer skills and trades training within the prison system\n\n7 Taxation and economy\n\n* Possibility to raise corporation tax\n* Ensure that corporations are actually paying taxes\n* Much greater regulation of the insurance industry is required\n* Lending practices need to be tightly regulated\n\n\n8 Other things\n\n\n* A standard tender process for government projects. This has to be something that all departments can follow and justify the reasons for awarding contracts. There should be strict controls to avoid overspend.\n* Politicians must divest themselves or move any businesses, investments and other conflicts of interest into the care of trustees. All financial interests must be declared.\n* Moratorium of politicians being able to take executive positions in companies after leaving office.\n* Outlawing political lobbying\n* Establish a rural affairs committee, to move away from parish politics and working towards helping rural communities who require similar assistance and help."

So for many years it's been handier to just stay put.\n\nI'm looking to know whether going into engineering might be worth a shot. I presume it'd mean more hands on work and maybe be a bit more motivating/stimulating as a career. Looking hopefully at something that'd involve building stuff. So civil, construction, electrical, or maybe even chemical.\n\nAnyone able to enlighten me on what type of course or qualifications I'd need to look into? Would I need to start a new B. Eng. from scratch or would my B. Sc. be transferrable in any way and I could just do a Masters or something?\n\nAdditionally if anyone can speak to what the actual job expectations would be compared to tech? Like would I be starting out on a much smaller salary and take a long time to develop a career as an engineer?\n\nAny help appreciated. I've been thinking about a major career overhaul for a long time. I'm 30 and watching my life drift away in an industry that isn't doing it for me."

And have a lot of questions. \n\nDo you guys use the metric system in construction?\nWhat is a normal salary in Ireland?\nWhy should a Irish company need someone from the Netherlands? Or is the west coast bad? I don\u2019t need much. Just a gym. \nLiving costs. What to expect for rent, insurance, internet, phone, all that nice stuff?\nWill I be able to understand you\u2019re Irish accent?\n\nI believe that my drivers license will be valid in Ireland, driving on the left side of the road will need some getting used to I guess. \n\nPlease r/Ireland, help me out. What are some nice websites to do a little research?"

I have **ZERO** idea\n\nWhat would be something to expect for a starting salary in IT?\n\nThanks a million"
